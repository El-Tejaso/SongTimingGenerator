Current objectives
 - Use the new HighPassFilter and LowPassFilter to isolate the light drum sound in the end of Test1-5.mp3
	- current methods are not doing this
	
	
Current thoughts:
	- I have been treating 2 channel data as simply 1 channel data with double the sample rate.
		it works for playback, but it may not work for various filtering algorithms that rely on the value of the last frame
