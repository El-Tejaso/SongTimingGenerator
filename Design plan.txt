What to do next time we start this project:

-> Make something similar in Python so that we can actually get a beat detection algorithm prototyped 

- Use the new HighPassFilter and LowPassFilter to isolate the light drum sound in the end of Test1-5.mp3
- figure out some way of making a tool that you can use to just isolate and time beats
